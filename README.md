1. Problem Understanding
The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using available data like age, gender, ticket class, etc. Itâ€™s a binary classification problem (Survived = 1, Not Survived = 0).

2. Data Collection
The dataset is provided by Kaggle and includes:
- train.csv: Passenger data with survival status.
- test.csv: Passenger data without survival status.
- gender_submission.csv: A sample submission format.
3. Data Exploration (EDA)
This step involves understanding the structure and patterns in the data:
- Identify missing values.
- Analyze distributions (e.g., age, fare).
- Study relationships (e.g., survival rate by gender or class).

4. Data Cleaning
Handle issues in the dataset:
- Fill missing values (e.g., median age).
- Remove or impute incomplete columns (e.g., drop Cabin).
- Standardize formats (e.g., convert text to categories).
5. Feature Engineering
Create new variables or transform existing ones to improve model performance:
- Combine SibSp and Parch into FamilySize.
- Convert Sex and Embarked into numerical values.
- Extract titles from names (e.g., Mr., Mrs., Miss).

6. Model Selection
Choose a machine learning algorithm suitable for classification:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines
  
7. Model Evaluation
Assess how well the model performs:
- Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall.
- Apply cross-validation to ensure reliability.

8. Prediction
Use the trained model to predict survival on the test dataset
